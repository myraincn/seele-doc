Q&A
===

1. Why is my node not synchronizing to the most recent blocks?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Seele utilizes a unique sharding technique. It requires your node to
connect to all the shards in order to process cross-shard transactions
flawlessly. If your node is not connected to a particular shard, it
cannot verify the block with cross-shard transactions from that shard.
Hence the synchronization stops. To check whether your node is connected
to all the shards, you can use

``./client p2p peersinfo``

under go-seele/build/ directory (after you build go-seele) to check all
the nodes you have connected to. You can see the shard information of
each node.

Sometimes it takes a long time to sync due to complicated network
environment. Please be patient.

2. How do I know if I have mined a block?
-----------------------------------------

You can check on `Seelescan <https://seelescan.net/>`__ with your
coinbase(account). Even though the log showing on your local machine
says you have mined a block, it may not be the final result on the
Mainnet because your mined block needs to be recognized by the mining
community. You may also use

``./client getbalance --account (your account) -a ip:port``

to check whether your balance is increasing. We recommend using the IP
of static nodes or some trusted IPs you find on Seelescan. The port
should be adjusted based on the shard. Shard 1: **8027**, shard 2:
**8028**, shard 3: **8029**, shard 4: **8026**.

3. How long does it take for a cross-shard transaction to complete?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The cross-shard transaction usually takes at least 20 minutes to
complete, normally between 20 minutes and 30 minutes. Seele has a uinque
mechanism to guarantee the ultimate safety of the cross-shard
transaction. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen the transaction completed
for a long time. Please report it to the team.

4. Is cross-shard contract supported in Seele?
----------------------------------------------

No. Currently we only support intra-shard contracts.

5. Where is the blockchain data stored on my computer?
------------------------------------------------------

By default, the data folder is ~/.seele. If you delete this folder and
restart your node, you will synchronize the data from scratch.

6. How to handle the “too many open files” error when you run a seele node?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mac’s default upper limit for the number of files a process can open at
the same time may be too low for a seele node.

In terminal, type the command

``launchctl limit maxfiles``.

The response should be

``maxfiles 256 unlimited``

where ``256`` is ‘soft limit’ and ``unlimited`` is ‘hard limit’.

Use the command

``sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 200000``

to change the two limits and this time the reponse to
``launchctl limit maxfiles`` should be ``maxfiles 65536 200000``. You’re
expected to input your password for the sudo command. Refer to this
`blog <https://medium.com/mindful-technology/too-many-open-files-limit-ulimit-on-mac-os-x-add0f1bfddde>`__
if the above didn’t solve your problem.
